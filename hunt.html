                <p><strong>1:</strong>Hidden on the first and second floor of the 87, there are three hidden slips of paper with unique #s. </p>
                <p><strong>2:</strong>If you collect all three of a unique number, you can redeem them for a free drink at CJs! You don't have to do the clue in order.</p>
                <p><strong>3:</strong>At each location, there will be multiple slips with numbers, so please only take whatever unique number you choose so other groups can try as well. Redeem you prize by giving Hamilton your 3 slips of paper with the same #.</p>

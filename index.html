                    <h3>Tommy</h3>
                    <p>Tommy did not submit his bio in time so management will have to write it for him. Tommy, as of the past few years, has been in a serious relationship with the jordan hall of science. In fact, that is where I suspect he is right now while he was suppossed to be writing his bio. Tommy is an avid Minnesota sports fan and can tell you all about the complete history of the Vikings. Tommy is also an RA in Keenan Hall and should be glorified for his service.</p>

                    <h3>Hamilton</h3>
                    <p>Hamilton is known for his ability to recite and sing almost all of Love Somebody. Additionally, he, along with his team, successfully destroyed the city of Nashville as they had never seen 6 white boys like them. Some of Hamilton's interests include JOOSE, Spanx (not in a weird way), waterski, and chat gpt-ing code.</p>

                    <h3>Lucca</h3>
                    <p>Lucca is a Brazilian who ventured the seas all the way from Porto Alegre to fulfill his dream of becoming a basic white boy. He is widely known for his obsession with white boards, his competitiveness, and watching all the sports franchises he cheers for fail miserably. He leads the 87 household in dishwasher emptying and total miles ran per week, attempting to reach Hamilton for the garbage emptying record.</p>

                    <h3>Rob</h3>
                    <p>Robert’s defining trait is that he is a strong supporter of the Albanian cause. He's had a tough week having been disenfranchised by the Bergen County Commissioner’s Office. Yesterday, he took up a new hobby of chugging Guinness to cope with the fact that his right to vote has been stripped away. He is also apart of the WHOOP family.</p>

He has survived the Dublin EasyHotel, endured fantasy football heartbreak, and become a regular at CJ’s Pub. Following the recent tour of the United States South he has been listening to this new Morgan Wallen song that’s pretty underground.</p>

He is an American Studies major (has he mentioned it yet?) and an RA (has he mentioned that yet?) and his favorite food is candy (he probably has not mentioned that yet). This Halloween, he wishes good tidings to all and to all a good (k)night!</p>
